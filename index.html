    <h3> ---------- About me ----------</h3>
 <p>&emsp;My name is Rohan Mandi, I am a Software engineering student at Western University with a passion for technology and progmramming.</p>
 <p>&emsp;I try my best to live an active and social lifestyle, doing my best to balance my personal life with my academic studies. I think it's very important to have such a balance, or else your going to burn yourself out. Life can't always be just work, you have to have room for some play as well.</p>
 <p>&emsp;During high school I developed a passion for martial arts, doing Shaolin Kung Fu Kempo under the most unsuspecting Shaolin disciple, who taught me to be the man that I am today. I learned dicipline, hard work, perseverence, and how to have fun.</p>
 <p>My goal is to work my dream job of being a game developer. Ever since I was a kid I've had a storng passion for video games. To be able to give  someone else sucha special, meaningful experience that can give them an escape or a touching story would mean the world to me.</p>
